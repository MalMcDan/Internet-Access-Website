<h2>MiFi Connection and Troubleshooting Guide</h2>
<div class="bar"><img src="img/stripes.png"></div>
<div class="content">
<p>If your child is using a mifi or is receiving one, we do not recommend traveling with the mifi. Please set up a designated place in your home where the mifi has the strongest signal and connect your child’s chrome book to the mifi.</p>

<p>To connect your child to their mifi please charge or plug in the mifi. </p>
<ul>
  <li>To turn on the mifi, please hold down the power button until the screen  on the mifi says “Welcome”</li>
<li>Once the mifi loads, you will see the screen says T-Mobile in the center. On the top left of the screen will be the signal strength and on the top right of the screen you will see the battery icon. To navigate through the menu on the mifi, please tap the power button. </li>
<li>To see the wi-fi name for the mifi, please tap the power button two times.</li>
<li>To connect your child’s Chrome Book to the mifi, please click on the network icon located in the bottom left corner of the screen. When the menu opens, please click on the network icon again, this should open the menu to select a wifi network. Look for the wifi name provided by the mifi. In most cases it starts with Franklin T9 followed by 4 numbers. Click on the wifi name. </li>
<li>After you click on the wifi name, you will be asked to provide a password. To find the password to the mifi please please tap the power button on the mifi 3 times or until you see the screen read Password: followed by eight letters and numbers. Type the letters and numbers into the password field in the Chrome Book.</li>
<li>Your child’s Chrome Book should now be connected to their mifi and they should be able to sign in and use the internet on the Chrome Book.</li>
</ul>

<p>If your child’s mifi is no longer working, please try restarting the mifi. Power off the mifi by holding down the power button until the screen reads “Goodbye.” Then turn the mifi back on and wait for your child’s Chrome Book to connect to the mifi . Check the connection by navigating to a webpage. If the webpage will not load or if the Chrome Book network connection says “no network” then you will need to reset the mifi. </p>

<p>To reset the mifi, take off the back cover while the mifi is still powered on. Next to the battery is a button that says “Reset” Please hold down the reset button until the screen on the mifi says “factory reset.”</p>

<p>Wait for the mifi to power back on and for your child’s Chrome Book to connect to the mifi. If you are still unable to get a network connection please call Rachel McDaniel at <a href="tel:7577272044">757-727-2044</a> to report the problem so it can be investigated.</p>

<p>If you are having trouble with your child’s Chrome Book please contact the Tech Helpline (M-TR 9am-3pm) at <a href="tel:7578506875">757-850-6875</a> or email at <a href="mailto:HCS-ITHelp@hampton.k12.va.us">HCS-ITHelp@hampton.k12.va.us</a></p>

<p>Please note:<strong> HCS has a limited supply of mifis. Replacements may not be available if a mifi is lost, stolen, or damaged.</strong></p></div>
